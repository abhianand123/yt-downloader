## Cookie Configuration (Bot Detection Bypass)

YouTube requires cookies to prevent bot detection, especially when hosted on cloud platforms. The app automatically tries to use browser cookies locally, but **you MUST configure cookies when deploying to Railway or other cloud platforms**.

### For Local Development

**Option 1: Automatic Browser Cookies**
The app automatically tries to use cookies from Chrome if available. Make sure you're logged into YouTube in your browser.

**Option 2: Manual Cookie File**
Export cookies and set the environment variable:

1. Install browser extension: ["Get cookies.txt LOCALLY"](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/get-cookiestxt-locally/cclelndahbckbenkjhflpdbgdldlbecc)
2. Go to YouTube and export cookies as `cookies.txt`
3. Set environment variable:
```bash
# Windows PowerShell
$env:YOUTUBE_COOKIES_TEXT=(Get-Content cookies.txt -Raw)
python app.py

# Linux/Mac
export YOUTUBE_COOKIES_TEXT="$(cat cookies.txt)"
python app.py
```

### For Railway/Cloud Deployment (REQUIRED)

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT:** Railway runs in containers without browser access. Cookies are **REQUIRED**.

1. Export cookies using "Get cookies.txt LOCALLY" browser extension
2. Copy the ENTIRE contents of `cookies.txt`
3. In Railway Dashboard ‚Üí Variables ‚Üí Add Variable:
   - Name: `YOUTUBE_COOKIES_TEXT`
   - Value: Paste the entire cookie file content
4. Railway will auto-redeploy

üìñ **Full Railway deployment guide**: See `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`
