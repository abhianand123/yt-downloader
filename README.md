## Cookie Configuration (Bot Detection Bypass)

YouTube may sometimes require authentication to prevent bot detection. The application automatically tries to use cookies from your Chrome browser. If you encounter authentication errors, you can:

### Option 1: Use Browser Cookies Automatically
The app will automatically try to use cookies from Chrome if available. Make sure you're logged into YouTube in your Chrome browser.

### Option 2: Export Cookies Manually
If automatic browser cookie detection doesn't work (e.g., on servers), you can export cookies manually:

1. Install a browser extension like "Get cookies.txt LOCALLY" or use yt-dlp's cookie export:
```bash
yt-dlp --cookies-from-browser chrome --cookies cookies.txt "https://www.youtube.com"
```

2. Save the exported cookies to a file (e.g., `cookies.txt`)

3. Set the environment variable before running the app:
```bash
# Windows PowerShell
$env:YOUTUBE_COOKIES_FILE="C:\path\to\cookies.txt"
python app.py

# Windows CMD
set YOUTUBE_COOKIES_FILE=C:\path\to\cookies.txt
python app.py

# Linux/Mac
export YOUTUBE_COOKIES_FILE="/path/to/cookies.txt"
python app.py
```
